When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaberating with someone, especially when not in the same office.  Or just to have available from any location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you pull manually you will expect the changes and anticipate potential problems.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is an exact copy of a repository at either local-local or github-local.  A Fork is at the GitHub level and is essentially a clone of a repository that also links back to the original.  A branch is an alternate track of a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This lets you know if the remote has changed releative to the local.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Either by sharing a network drive space or sending files back and forth.  Clearly Git and GitHub are easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
